# Comparative-Analysis-of-Machine-Learning-Models-for-Loan-Default-Prediction

This project aims to predict the likelihood of loan default using machine learning models based on financial and demographic data. The dataset was obtained from Kaggle, containing customer-level features related to income, employment, credit history, and loan status.

**Project Overview**

The goal of this project is to build and compare multiple classification models to identify potential loan defaulters. Various preprocessing techniques, feature selection, and class balancing were applied to improve model performance and reliability.

Models Implemented

Logistic Regression
Decision Tree
Random Forest
Gradient Boosting
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
